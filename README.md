# Breast Cancer Classification Machine Learning Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning project focused on breast cancer classification. The notebook uses various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on specific features extracted from breast cancer biopsies.

## About the Notebook

Breast cancer classification is a crucial application of machine learning in the medical field. This notebook showcases the end-to-end process of creating a reliable model for distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/devang-kumawat/Breast_Cancer_Predictor.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the directory where the notebook is located:
cd Breast_Cancer_Predictor

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch a Jupyter Notebook environment and open the `Breast_Cancer_Classification_ML.ipynb` notebook.

4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the notebook cells step by step to observe the breast cancer classification process. The notebook provides explanations and code comments to guide you through each stage.

## Dependencies

The notebook relies on various Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. You can find the necessary dependencies specified at the beginning of the notebook. Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the notebook.
